Absolutely! Here is a **ready-to-use, precise prompt** you can use with me (or any advanced code AI) in the future to get a scalable, decoupled Unity architecture for **any game**:

---

### **Prompt:**

```
I want you to generate a scalable Unity project architecture for a [GAME GENRE OR CONCEPT HERE], using a clean Model-View-Controller (MVC) or Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) separation.

**Requirements:**
- The core game state and logic should be in plain C# classes (“models”) that do NOT inherit from MonoBehaviour.
- All UI code (views) should only listen to the model’s state changes via events or data binding, never directly update UI from the gameplay logic.
- Managers (controllers) should handle input, call model methods, and relay state changes.
- Use ScriptableObjects for static data/configuration if appropriate.
- Provide code examples for:
    - The main game state class
    - A MonoBehaviour manager/controller
    - Example UI scripts (that subscribe to model events)
    - (Optionally) a ScriptableObject event channel for extra decoupling

Assume a professional, maintainable codebase that could scale to a large project or team.

Explain the file/folder structure briefly as well.

GAME CONCEPT: [INSERT YOUR GAME IDEA HERE]
```

---

### **How to Use:**

1. **Replace** `[GAME GENRE OR CONCEPT HERE]` with your specific game type.
   Example: “turn-based tactics game”, “match-3 puzzle”, “idle clicker”, etc.

2. **Replace** `[INSERT YOUR GAME IDEA HERE]` with a one-liner about your game.
   Example: “A city-building strategy game with upgrades and resource management.”

GAME CONCEPT: “A colorful match-3 puzzle game with combos and power-ups.”

**Save this prompt!** It will work for word games, action games, management games, and more—just swap out the genre and concept each time.
If you use it with me, I’ll deliver a modern, scalable Unity architecture with clean code samples and file structure every time.
