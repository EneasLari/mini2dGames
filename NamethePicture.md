Here's how you can implement the **"Name the Picture"** game in Unity:

---

### **Game Features:**

1. **Image Display:** Random image appears.
2. **Multiple-Choice Options:** Four-letter choices given.
3. **Win Condition:** Player selects the correct word.
4. **Learning Aspects:** Image recognition, UI interactions, dictionary lookup.

---

I'll provide the **Unity C# script** along with a **basic UI setup**. The script will:

- Load random images from a folder.
- Display multiple-choice options.
- Check if the player's selection is correct.

---

Now, letâ€™s create the Unity project. I'll generate a **C# script** to handle the game logic.

### **Steps to Use This Script:**

1. **Create a UI Layout** in Unity:

   - Add an **Image** (`displayImage`).
   - Add four **Button** elements (`optionTexts` inside buttons).
   - Add a **Canvas** and **EventSystem**.

2. **Assign the Script:**

   - Attach this script to an empty **GameObject**.
   - Assign UI elements in the Inspector.

3. **Load Images:**

   - Add images to `Resources/Sprites/` in Unity.
   - Drag them into the `images` array in the Inspector.
   - Add corresponding names in `imageNames`.

4. **Connect Button Clicks:**
   - In the **Inspector**, for each button, add `SelectOption(int index)` and pass the correct index.

Now, your **"Name the Picture"** game is functional! ðŸŽ‰ Let me know if you need additional features like timers or animations. ðŸš€
